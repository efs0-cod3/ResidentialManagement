# My process

## Built with

- HTML5 markup on EJS
- CSS custom properties and some boostrap usage
- Flexbox
- Mobile first
- Express - Node framework
- Bcrypt
- Mongoose
- Passport
- and others

## What I learned

Started to use MVC paradigm wich facilitate thing with organization an helped me to identify efficienty where to go when changing things in code.

I actually learned lots of new stuff with this project and the usage of modules that i didn't know until now.

Ex:
- connect-flash: The flash is a special area of the session used for storing messages. Messages are written to the flash and cleared after being displayed to the user. 

- bcrypt: To help you hash passwords.

- Passport: an authentication middleware for Node.js

- Mongoose: Is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Easiest to do certain stuff than with mongodb.
